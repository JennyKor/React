<p><b>user_registration:</b> A simple registration form that consists of two components. The App.js has the states for saving values, and the UserForm.js accesses them through props and renders the actual form. The latter component also checks that no field is left empty. There's no verification that input is actually valid, but it's a good start.</p>
